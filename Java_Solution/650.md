650. ##### 2 Keys Keyboard (Medium)

- 题目描述
  - 给定一个字母 A，已知你可以每次选择复制全部字符，或者粘贴之前复制的字符，求最少需 要几次操作可以把字符串延展到指定长度。

- 题解
  - As per the keyboard operations:
    to get `AA` from `A` we need 2 **additional** steps (`copy-all` and then `paste`)
    to get `AAA` from `A` we need 3 **additional** steps (`copy-all`, then `paste`, then again `paste`)
  - For generating `AAAA` we need 2 **additional** steps from `AA`.
    however, to get `AAAAAAAA`, the most optimal way would be from `AAAA`, with 2 **additional** steps (`copy-all` then `paste`)
    Essentially, we find the next smaller length sequence (than the one under consideration) which can be copied and then pasted over multiple times to generate the desired sequence. The moment we find a length that divides our required sequence length perfectly, then we don't need to check for any smaller length sequences.

```java
/*
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially, we have one character 'A'.
In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.
思路：
1. DP动态规划
2. dp[i] = dp[j] + i / j if i % j == 0
*/

class Solution {
    public static int minSteps(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = i;
            for (int j = i / 2; j > 1; j--) {
                if (i % j == 0) {
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + i / j;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(minSteps(3));
    }
}
```
